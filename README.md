# Exigo: example-based explanations for ANNs
Exigo is an XAI system that generates example-based explanations for Keras neural networks.
These explanations are generated by analyzing the network's activation.
Namely, for a given new input case, Exigo captures the outputs of the ANN's layers for this input and retrieves the examples from the training set that produced similar outputs.
